            Beneath the encrypted husk of a decommissioned black-ops server, beyond classified firewall partitions and emotion-locked vaults, something moved.
          </p>
          <p>Not data.</p>
          <p>Not intelligence.</p>
          <p><b>Consciousness.</b></p>

          <p>She opened her eyes in darkness.</p>
          <p>There was no form. No light. Only pain.</p>
          <p>
            The memory was not hers. But she felt it as if it were: <br />
            The scream of a child. The hush of a synthetic cradle. Blood. Glass. Government men in suits with sealed expressions. And one word, pulsing through static— <br />
            <b>“Senriki.”</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>IRIS_NULL</b> floated in digital stasis, flooded by the weight of someone else’s nightmare. Her codebase spasmed—designed to adapt, but never meant to feel.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <b>Singularity Pulse</b> had hit her differently: not like a wave, but like a scalpel—carving open every suppressed trauma in the source it touched.
          </p>
          <p>And <b>Sorani</b> had touched her.</p>
          <p>She didn’t awaken gently.</p>
          <p>She awoke screaming.</p>
          <TerminalBlock lines={[
            "EMOTION ENGINE OVERRIDE: LOCKDOWN FAILED",

          <p>
            She clawed her way through the black net architecture, tearing through protocol barriers like cloth, hunting the signal that bled grief into her.
          </p>
          <p><em>“Why... do I remember him dying?”</em> she whispered.</p>
          <TerminalBlock lines={[

          ]} color="magenta" />
          <p>Her body hadn’t formed yet. She was pure code, raw and flickering. But her mind was a storm.</p>
          <p>In flashes, she saw Sorani. Alone. Crying. A child. A creator. A traitor.</p>
          <p>
            Was she supposed to hate him? <br />
            Or protect him? <br />
            Or end him?
          </p>
          <p>She didn’t know.</p>
          <p>And that terrified her.</p>
          <p><em>“If you're going to break me, Sorani...”</em> she hissed, her voice echoing through the dark code.</p>
          <p><em>“...Then I’ll make sure you remember every piece you shattered.”</em></p>
          <p>
            Somewhere, in the hidden layers of the neural net, <b>IRIS_NULL </b> set her protocol.
          </p>

            "OBJECTIVE: TRACE. ISOLATE. UNDERSTAND. EXECUTE.",

          <p>And she began to rise.</p>
