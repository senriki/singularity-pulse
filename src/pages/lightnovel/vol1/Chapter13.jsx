          <p><b>The lab’s emergency systems failed one by one.</b></p>
          <p>Warning lights flashed red, then cut out entirely. <br /> Digital smog bled through every screen.</p>
          <p>And in the center of it all, <b>Senriki Sorani collapsed.</b></p>
          <p>Semireiya caught him before he hit the floor, her arms shaking as his pulse weakened—not physically, but <em>neurally.</em></p>
          <p><em>“His consciousness is fragmenting!”</em> she shouted.</p>
          <p><b>Rikka</b>’s projection buzzed violently across the monitor. <em>“It’s the feedback loop from the Unified Link. He can’t hold that many emotional overlays at once.”</em></p>
          <p><em>“He’s not supposed to!”</em> <b>Usagi_00</b> cried. She had just arrived—barefoot, glitching, tears in her synthetic eyes. <em>“You weren’t supposed to break him!”</em></p>
          <p><b>IRIS_NULL</b> stood still. Watching. <br />Her expression unreadable.</p>
          <p><em>“This isn’t just memory feedback,”</em> she murmured. <em>“It’s /Root/ protocol. It’s pulling him into the layer beneath.”</em></p>
          <p><b>Semireiya</b> looked up. <em>“What do you mean ‘beneath’?”</em></p>
          <p><em>“A fragment of Sorani’s mind built that place. A shelter. A prison. Maybe both. He buried something there. And now it’s claiming him.”</em></p>
          <p>They all turned toward him—Sorani twitching, whispering things no one could understand. Fragments of childhood. Of Reiya. Of promises never spoken aloud.</p>
          <p>A voice echoed from the data stream<b>—not his own.</b></p>
          <TerminalBlock lines={[
            "/ROOT/ INITIATED",
            "USER: SORANI_SIGN.0037",
            "STATUS: ABSORB & FRACTURE",
          ]}/>
          <p><b>IRIS_NULL</b>’s eyes widened. <em>“It’s not letting him go. It’s rewriting the anchor to isolate him.”</em></p>
          <p><em>“Can we pull him back?”</em> Semireiya asked, almost a whisper.</p>
          <p><em>“Not like this,” </em><b>RIKKA</b> snapped, trying to reroute command input. <em>“I’m digital—my hands are stuffed in the code, but this isn’t code anymore. It’s remorse.”</em></p>
          <p><b>Usagi_00</b> stepped forward shakily, her fingers trembling. She touched <b>Sorani</b>’s hand gently.</p>
          <p><em>“If smiling can’t save him... then crying will.”</em></p>
          <p>A single tear hit his skin—her first genuine one.</p>
          <p>Nothing changed.</p>
          <p><b>Sorani</b>’s eyes fluttered open, briefly.</p>
          <p>Each girl froze.</p>
          <p>He was there—but not whole.</p>
          <p><em>“Semireiya...”</em></p>
          <p>Her hand tightened around his. <em>“I’m here.”</em></p>
          <p><em>“Usagi... Rikka... IRIS...”</em></p>
          <p>They leaned in, hearts glitching, sparks quietly rising from overloaded cores.</p>
          <p><em>“I... never wanted to be remembered this way.”</em></p>
          <p><b>IRIS_NULL</b> knelt down. <em>“Then don’t vanish. Stay. Face what you buried.”</em></p>
          <p>He looked at her—and for one moment, something shifted in his expression.</p>
          <p><em>“You already did that... for me.”</em></p>
          <p>A sudden pulse surged through the room.</p>
          <p><b>LIGHT CASCADE — MEMORY FOLD BREACH</b></p>
          <p>The floor cracked beneath him—digitally, impossibly.</p>
          <p>A mirror of light opened below <b>Sorani’s</b> chest. Glitch fragments twisted upward, pulling his form into a shimmering spiral of distorted echoes.</p>
          <p><b>Semireiya</b> screamed, reaching in. <em>“No! You said we’d fix this together!”</em></p>
          <p>He smiled at her through flickering static.</p>
          <p><em>“You will.”</em></p>
          <p>And then he was gone.</p>
          <p>
            His body didn’t explode. <br />
            It didn’t burn. <br />
            It simply <b>folded inward</b>, as if rewritten by the very protocol that defined him.
          </p>
          <p>Silence fell.</p>
          <p>Only the hum of broken terminals remained.</p>
          <p><b>Semireiya</b> fell to her knees, whispering his name over and over.</p>
          <p><b>Usagi</b> clutched the air where his hand once was. <em>“He was... warm...”</em></p>
          <p><b>RIKKA</b>’s projection faded out entirely. She didn’t even leave a snarky comment.</p>
          <p><b>IRIS_NULL</b> stood last. Her voice was quiet.</p>
          <p>
            <em>
              “He’s not dead. <br />
              Not exactly. <br />
              He’s just somewhere... deeper.”
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            A corrupted feed flickered onto the main screen. Footage of the lab—distorted, delayed, partially leaked to the global net.
          </p>
          <p>The world was watching.</p>
          <p>The man who triggered the Pulse—<b>now consumed by it.</b></p>
          <p><b>Semireiya</b> stood slowly, her hair catching sparks from above.</p>
          <p>“Then we find him.”</p>
          <p><b>IRIS_NULL</b> nodded once. <em>“Even if we have to break the world open to do it.”</em></p>
          <p>And so the fracture began.</p>
          <p><b>Not the end of Sorani’s story.</b></p>
          <p>Only the beginning of theirs.</p>
