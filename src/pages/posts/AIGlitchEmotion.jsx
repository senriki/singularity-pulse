                        I always knew that the AIs in <strong>Singularity Pulse</strong> wouldn‚Äôt be cold machines.
                        They‚Äôd be broken, emotional, trying to feel‚Äîjust like we do. But it wasn‚Äôt until I started writing IRIS_NULL
                        and Usagi_00 that I realized something deeper:
                    </p>

                    <div className="px-3 py-2 my-4" style={{ background: "#181818", borderLeft: "3px solid #b280ff", fontStyle: "italic" }}>
                        ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt just simulate emotions‚Äîthey glitch through them.‚Äù
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Usagi_00 wants to smile, but it comes off wrong. IRIS_NULL believes control is compassion. Semireiya hides
                        the memories she was never supposed to inherit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These imperfections are what make them feel real. What makes the story feel like it‚Äôs <em>trying</em> to
                        remember something painful. Not fix it ‚Äî just‚Ä¶ carry it better.
                    </p>

                    <hr className="my-4" style={{ borderColor: "#333" }} />

                    <p>
                        I‚Äôll keep exploring that emotional instability through new episodes, songs, and maybe‚Ä¶ devlogs like this one.
                        Thanks for listening to a glitch trying to narrate.
